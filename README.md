This is a Supervised Machine Learning project done on Bank Customer Churn data. The data is obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains data of several different factors that affects churn in Bank customers.

The aim of this project is to perform classification using different ML models after pre-processing the data. Thus customer churn is predicted using different models like - (a) Logistic Regression, (b) K Nearest Neighbours, (c) Decision Trees, (d) Random Forest, (e) Stacking models.

Evaluation metrics such as - accuracy, recall, precision, f1 score etc are used to compare the performance of different models. And finally feature importance is also studied and visualized to identify the important features for determining customer churn.
